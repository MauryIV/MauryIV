# Hello Everyone!


## Current Projects

At the moment, I am revisiting some projects from school to polish them further. I am working on a few projects including a game I am in the process of creating and a musical ticketing application. I am also working with a business owner to build a website for her.


## Currently Learning

I am working to perfect my JavaScript knowledge and have been working on algorithms as well. But I do love picking up new tools to help in that process. Other languages are something I can't wait to tackle, but I want to be sure to have extensive knowledge to make transitioning more simplistic.


## Collaborations

I do have a few different collaborations with my peers from the bootcamp. I'm excited to continue to grow with them and learn more. That being said, I love making new relationships. If you ever want to collaborate sometime, please reach out!


## Support

I am currently looking for work and ways to improve. If you have any resources, I'd love to hear them!


## About Me

I am relatively new to the industry, having just graduated from a coding bootcamp, and I can’t wait to get my foot in the door. For most of my life, I didn’t see this as an option since computers were hard to come by in my household growing up. However, after developing new friendships with people in the industry, I decided to try something new and developed a strong interest. I can't wait to find a career in this industry and be happy doing something I love.
